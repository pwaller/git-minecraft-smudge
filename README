git-minecraft-smudge
--------------------

Abusing git's filter mechanism for fun and profit.

Purpose
-------

This results in a drastic space saving when using git to track minecraft anvil
files. It works by decompressing minecraft's chunk data so that git's delta
compression can work more effectively on it.

Why?
----

I want to have backups for two purposes, one to see how it evolves over a long
period of time, and another in case we have a severe problem (nuke going off)
which we need to fix.

Result
------
For 10 saves with a significant amount of stuff done to them, the resulting git
repository was only 7% larger than the final save itself. A regular `git gc` is
needed.

Usage
-----

In your `.gitconfig` (doesn't cause anything by itself):

	[filter "minecraft-anvil"]
		clean = git-minecraft-smudge clean -
		smudge = git-minecraft-smudge smudge -

and in your `.gitattributes` in your world folder or higher:

	*.mca minecraft-anvil

note: this renders the repository unusable without `git-minecraft-smudge`.
